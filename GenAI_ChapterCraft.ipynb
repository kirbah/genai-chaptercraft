        "# GenAI ChapterCraft: Automated Video Chapter Generation\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overview:**\n",
        "\n",
        "GenAI ChapterCraft is a free tool for automatically generating video chapters using AI. This Colab notebook demonstrates how to transcribe video audio and use a Large Language Model (LLM) to create SEO-friendly chapters with timestamps.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Audio Transcription:** Uses `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo` (or `openai/whisper-tiny` for CPU) for audio-to-text conversion.\n",
        "*   **Audio Download:** Downloads audio from video URLs (e.g., Vimeo) using `yt_dlp`.\n",
        "*   **LLM Chapter Creation:** Employs an LLM (`Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct` by default) to generate chapters from the transcript.\n",
        "*   **SRT Output:** Converts the transcript to SRT format.\n",
        "*   **GPU optimized:** If GPU is available in the colab, the notebook will take advantage of it.\n",
        "*   **Free and open-source.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Process:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Video Input:** Takes a video URL or uses existing YouTube video transcript.\n",
        "2.  **Audio Extraction:** If needed, downloads audio as an MP3 using `yt_dlp`.\n",
        "3.  **Transcription:** Transcribes audio to text using `openai/whisper`.\n",
        "4.  **SRT Conversion:** Converts the transcript into SRT format.\n",
        "5.  **Chapter Generation:**  LLM analyzes the transcript and creates chapters with timestamps.\n",
        "6. **Hugging Face usage**: LLM integration via Hugging Face Inference API. HF\\_TOKEN is required.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Saves time on manual chapter creation.\n",
        "*   Improves video searchability with SEO-friendly chapters.\n",
        "* Enhances the viewer's experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Google Colab.\n",
        "*   AI Studio (GEMINI\\_API\\_KEY) key. Create new key on the [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).\n",
        "*   Hugging Face account and API token (HF\\_TOKEN). Create new token on [Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)\n",
        "*   Supadate account token (SUPADATA\\_TOKEN) to retrieve Youtube transcription. Create [new account and token](https://supadata.ai/).\n",
        "*   GPU runtime for faster run (highly recommended).\n",
        "\n",
        "**How to use it:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Enter the video url.\n",
        "2. Set SUPADATA\\_TOKEN in the secrets (small key on the right side).\n",
        "3. Set HF\\_TOKEN in the secrets.\n",
        "4. Set GEMINI\\_API\\_KEY\n",
        "5. Set SUPADATA\\_TOKEN in the secrets.\n",
        "6. Run all code blocks sequentially (Ctrl + F9 or Runtime -> Run all).\n",
        "7. Enjoy the generated transcript and chapters."

since bergie's numbers only go\\n\\n138\\n00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,120\\nup to 10 we now need to find the closest\\n\\n139\\n00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,520\\nValue to 7. 388 on our outer ring and\\n\\n140\\n00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,639\\nline it up with the closest Value to\\n\\n141\\n00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,880\\n3857 on our inner ring we now just have\\n\\n142\\n00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,280\\nto look for where the starting point of\\n\\n143\\n00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,639\\nour inner ring intersects our outer ring\\n\\n144\\n00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,120\\nlooks like about\\n\\n145\\n00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,199\\n1.95 this is the correct answer here the\\n\\n146\\n00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,080\\narrangement of our diss is performing\\n\\n147\\n00:05:51,199 -->

that line up\\n\\n150\\n00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,479\\nreally nicely with bergies numbers this\\n\\n151\\n00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,319\\nof course won't always be the case and\\n\\n152\\n00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,600\\nmost circular slide roles have lots and\\n\\n153\\n00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,199\\nlots of nice tick marks usually allowing\\n\\n154\\n00:06:05,600 -->

his incredible new\\n\\n157\\n00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,479\\ndiscovery basically nothing he kept his\\n\\n158\\n00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,240\\nDiscovery mostly secret for his own work\\n\\n159\\n00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,639\\nalthough he did share with a friend the\\n\\n160\\n00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240\\nastronomer Johannes Kepler at the time\\n\\n161\\n00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,520\\nKepler was working on the rudolphine\\n\\n162\\n00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,319\\ntables which gave equations and tables\\n\\n163\\n00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,919\\nfor the precise location of the stars\\n\\n164\\n00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,319\\nand planets from any where on Earth an\\n\\n165\\n00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:36,160\\nenormous computational effort greatly\\n\\n166\\n00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,160\\naided by bergy's work Kepler included\\n\\n167\\n00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,360\\nthis line in the final ruding tables\\n\\n168\\n00:06:38,160 -->
